                    <p>
                        In classical computing, all information is units of data called bits consisting of  binary codes (0 or 1),
                        and bits are processed sequentially. In quantum computing, a unit of data is represented by qubit.
                        There is a major difference between the two. As opposed to bits which can experience only two
                        states: 0 and 1, qubits can take on various values at one time and can perform calculations
                        that a conventional computer cannot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Right now, quantum computing is still in its infancy.
                        But in a not so distant future if large-scale quantum computers can be built,
                        they will be able to solve certain problems exponentially faster than any of our current classical
                        computers (for example Shor's algorithm).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This ability would allow a quantum computer to "break" many of the cryptographic systems in use today.
                        How can we claim that our custody will be quantum-safe? Simply because we generate our cryptographic
                        keys in a different way than the vast majority of players in the cryptography field.
                        We are not using any complex key-generating algorithms that quantum computers will be able to crack.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We use a different procedure, a truly random iteration to generate keypairs for our clients.
                        Actually, randomness is enhanced so that there is no semblance of  order in key generation whatsoever.
                        To crack those keys, even a quantum computer might keep trying for thousands of years without success.
                        Of note, we refresh our client’s keybase much more often - like every month or so.

                        It does not mean that you remain totally unknown
                        to the platform, because for dealmaking, a KYC routine is required.
                        (this is the only disclosure needed from you at any stage of using our services).

                    <p>
                        But your identity remains hidden from untrusted parties until you decide to disclose it.
                        Even better, you can take several phantom identities at once, one per each counterparty.

                        Smart contracts (we would rather call persistent scripts) are really the bouts of code aimed at
                        automating the execution process of an agreement. Smart contracts can be programmed on blockchain,
                        or outside of it by using a Domain Specific Language. Smart contracts offer a higher guarantee
                        of security compared to the traditional contract and are also agiler, providing multiple
                        advantages to organizations and thanks to the blockchain on which they are mostly based,
                        transactions are faster, automated, less expensive and protected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, a smart contract has no legal value because it is not validated by any trusted third
                        party (a notary) and is not signed by the parties who use it. There is no formal recognition
                        of smart contracts legal validity yet. In consequence, no claims or legal enforcement can be
                        applied to a smart contract. But as soon as a smart contract becomes assorted with legally
                        binding e-signatures, it acquires full legal weight.

Right now if you trust your digital assets are stored on an exchange, with a payment provider or other such platforms, you do not really hold them - the said platform only gives you an IOY (I owe you) promise. In the zero-knowledge self-custody realm things are much different - no one can hijack your wealth or data. Only you know the keys to the encryption. You can also ensure that your loved ones can properly inherit those assets in case of any unfortunate and unforeseen circumstance.
