                </h2>
                <span class="shop-gifts__text">
                        <p>
                            In classical computing, all information is units of data called bits consisting of binary
                            codes (0 or 1),
                            and bits are processed sequentially. In quantum computing, a unit of data is represented by
                            qubit.
                            There is a major difference between the two. As opposed to bits which can experience only
                            two
                            states: 0 and 1, qubits can take on various values at one time and can perform calculations
                            that a conventional computer cannot.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Right now, quantum computing is still in its infancy.
                            But in a not so distant future if large-scale quantum computers can be built,
                            they will be able to solve certain problems exponentially faster than any of our current
                            classical
                            computers (for example Shor's algorithm).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This ability would allow a quantum computer to "break" many of the cryptographic systems in
                            use today.
                            How can we claim that our custody will be quantum-safe? Simply because we generate our
                            cryptographic
                            keys in a different way than the vast majority of players in the cryptography field.
                            We are not using any complex key-generating algorithms that quantum computers will be able
                            to crack.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We use a different procedure, a truly random iteration to generate keypairs for our clients.
                            Actually, randomness is enhanced so that there is no semblance of order in key generation
                            whatsoever.
                            To crack those keys, even a quantum computer might keep trying for thousands of years
                            without success.
                            Of note, we refresh our client’s keybase much more often - like every month or so.

                            to the platform, because for dealmaking, a KYC routine is required.
                            (this is the only disclosure needed from you at any stage of using our services).

                            But your identity remains hidden from untrusted parties until you decide to disclose it.
                            Even better, you can take several phantom identities at once, one per each counterparty.

                            Smart contracts (we would rather call persistent scripts) are really the bouts of code aimed
                            at
                            automating the execution process of an agreement. Smart contracts can be programmed on
                            blockchain,
                            or outside of it by using a Domain Specific Language. Smart contracts offer a higher
                            guarantee
                            of security compared to the traditional contract and are also agiler, providing multiple
                            advantages to organizations and thanks to the blockchain on which they are mostly based,
                            transactions are faster, automated, less expensive and protected.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, a smart contract has no legal value because it is not validated by any trusted
                            third
                            party (a notary) and is not signed by the parties who use it. There is no formal recognition
                            of smart contracts legal validity yet. In consequence, no claims or legal enforcement can be
                            applied to a smart contract. But as soon as a smart contract becomes assorted with legally
                            binding e-signatures, it acquires full legal weight.

                    When your employees have to sign in the name of your company, it’s quite handy to be able to
                    embed their signing permissions and spending limits into their e-signatures. When their
                    e-signatures are associated with smart contracts chosen by you, you have one less headache about
                    controls.

                    <p>Multi-signature (multisig) wallet — a type of wallet that requires more than one key to authorize a transaction.A multi-signature wallet works like a safe which needs multiple keys to operate. This type of wallet is used mainly for two purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1.        To ensure more security for a wallet and prevent a human error.</li>
    <li>2.       To create a more decentralized wallet which can be used by one or more people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually, the keys are issued to a number of owners to manage the risk. Those keys can also be issued to the same individual to enhance security of access. To perform any transactions all parties or specific share of them need to sign off on it (depends on the wallet and its terms). Thus, when a hacker aims at stealing funds, it’s hardly possible for them to carry most of the private keys. Moreover, if one of the owners loses the private key, he and she can always turn to a private backup key. This is why this very safe method of safekeeping the access to your digital wealth can both fit private individuals and organizations.</p>
